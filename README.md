# **🧤 PRIYANSHU – THE GOALKEEPER WHO CODES & DEFENDS SYSTEMS 🏆💻**  

"Some people breathe air. I breathe logic, football, and caffeine." ☕⚽💻

🚀 Born to Code, Built to Play
Imagine this: It’s the 90th minute of a football match. The score is tied. The stadium is silent. You take the final shot—GOAL! 🏆

Now replace the stadium with VS Code, the ball with a blinking cursor, and the goal with a perfectly optimized algorithm. That’s my life. A never-ending match between problem-solving and execution.

While others saw coding as a skill, I saw it as a battlefield, where every bug is an opponent, every debug is a tackle, and every successful deployment is a victory dance. 

I don’t just code. **I defend, optimize, and build like a goalkeeper on the field.**

## **🛠 My Tech Arsenal – The Defense Line I Trust**  

Great goalkeepers need great reflexes. **Great developers need great tools.**  
Here’s what I use to keep my code clean and my systems fast:  

### **⚡ Frontend (Because First Impressions Matter)**  
- **Next.js (App Router), React.js, Tailwind CSS** – Snappy, sleek, and smooth.  

### **🔥 Backend (Because Strength is in the Core)**  
- **Node.js, Express.js, Hono, Django** – **Built for speed and reliability.**  
- **Redis** – Because a fast cache beats searching every time.  
- **Zod & Drizzle ORM** – Schema validation and database queries **without pain.**  

### **🚀 Databases (The Real Powerhouse)**  
- **MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL** – Scaling data **without breaking a sweat.**  

### **🐳 DevOps & Cloud (Because Deployment Shouldn’t be a Nightmare)**  
- **Docker, AWS (EC2, RDS, Amplify), Kubernetes, Cloudflare**  
- **Dockerode + Nginx + HTTP Proxy** – Because **containers need a commander.**  

I don’t just use tech. **I make it work for me.**

## **🏆 The Projects That Kept Me Awake at 3 AM**  

_"Every dev has that one project that broke them and made them better at the same time."_  
I have a few:  

### **🔥 OxyFlow – Dynamic Reverse Proxy that Just Works**  
Tired of static configurations? I built a **reverse proxy that dynamically adapts.** **No more restarting, no more manual headaches.**  

### **💌 Postie (SIH 2024 Winning Project)**  
Redefining India's postal system with **AI-powered tracking, automated workflows, and real-time delivery insights.**  

### **🎮 Campus Play – Sports Meets Tech**  
A sports management platform that makes organizing **college sports tournaments feel like the FIFA World Cup.**  

### **🍔 Nova Nosh – Food Ordering, The Right Way**  
MERN-based food ordering system with **razor-sharp payments and real-time order tracking.**  

### **🛍️ Salon 85 – SEO Meets Next.js**  
An **SEO-optimized salon booking platform**—because **Google rankings matter.**  

I don’t just build projects. **I solve problems and disrupt industries.**

## **💭 My Random Thoughts While Coding**  

- "What if I refactor this part? ...Wait, it's 3 AM already?"  
- "Why is this bug laughing at me?"  
- "Just one more feature... Okay, maybe two."  
- "Football practice or fixing this last bug? Damn."  
- "How can I dockerize my breakfast?" 🐳
